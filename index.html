                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b class="animate-charctersa">I will not lie, cheat, or steal.</b>
                    </li>

                    <p> In my APUSH class, many around me decide to cheat through exams and quizzes,
                        I have had many opportunities to do the same, although I choose not to.
                        If I cheat myself now, I will also cheat myself during the AP exam, where there is
                        no chance of cheating.</p>

                    <li>
                        <b class="animate-charctersa"> I will think outside the box.</b>
                    </li>

                    <p> After SCLA, I have always tried to think outside of the box. An example of me thinking
                        outside of the box
                        is in my physics class. We were assigned to create a popsicle stick bazooka and
                        consistently hit an object four times
                        in a row. Many other groups chose to create complicated and sophisticated designs and
                        failed to meet the goal. Instead
                        I made a straightforward design that was, in reality, a slingshot. I hit the object four
                        times and left with an A.
                    </p>

                    <li>
                        <b class="animate-charctersa">I believe nothing is hard just a lot of work.</b>
                    </li>

                    <p> The idealogy of believing nothing is hard, just a lot of work, has stuck with me after
                        SCLA. I have applied this thinking into all most everything I do, whether it's school,
                        games, or general. For example, APUSH is not hard; it is just a lot of reading. Or a
                        game like VALORANT, VALORANT is not difficult; it just requires a lot of playing to
                        develop your skills.
